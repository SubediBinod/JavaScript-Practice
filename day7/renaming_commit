Certainly! Here are the steps in text format:

1. **Make your changes**:
   First, make the necessary changes to your files.

2. **Stage the changes**:
   Add the changes to the staging area using `git add`.

   ```bash
   git add <file1> <file2> ...
   ```

3. **Amend the commit**:
   Once the changes are staged, you can use the `--amend` option with `git commit` to replace the previous commit with the staged changes.

   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
   ```

   Replace `"New commit message"` with the desired commit message.

4. **Push the changes (if needed)**:
   If you've already pushed the previous commit to a remote repository, you'll need to force-push the amended commit.

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

   Be cautious with force-push (`--force`), especially if you're collaborating with others on the same branch. It rewrites history, which can cause conflicts if others have based their work on the previous commit.
